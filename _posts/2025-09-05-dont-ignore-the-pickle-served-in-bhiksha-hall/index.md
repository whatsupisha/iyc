I usually go to non spicy section & always used to wonder why they serve pickle in non spicy section too.

It occured to me after a month that most of the times the food does not have any probiotic/curd. Pickle is the only source of Vitamin B12 I guess.

Does anybody else has an opinion on this ? Any doctors ?
