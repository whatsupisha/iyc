During shakti chalana onboarding,  the teacher explicitly said that it is important to have both nostrils open before you do Mahata Prana kriya else the kriya may cause imbalance.

During severe cold, the nose opening exercises work momentarily but by the time you get done with sukh kriya, your nose will be blocked again.

Do you guys skip doing shakti chalana during cold or you still go ahead & do it. Sadhguru has talked about 8% of Nimhans cases due to improper yoga. I want to make sure I dont end up one of those :).
