Apparently the temp Akshaya seva is only for morning session 5:30-8:30 but somehow in the Sadhanapada attendance app, there is another afternoon entry, which gets marked as absent.

Make sure to raise a request in Sadhanapada app to get the afternoon session marked excused otherwise you will have unnecessary absent entries. Going by how secretly things are kept in Sadhanapada as to how you are being monitored, this can potentially work against you if things go south. 

Take care & make it happen :).
