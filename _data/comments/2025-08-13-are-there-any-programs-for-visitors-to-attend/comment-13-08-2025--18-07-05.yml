message: Do take a dip in Surya/Chandra kund before visiting the temple. Try to stay till evening so that you can see Divya Darshan (light show) at around 7:15 pm . Eat food at Moondram (restaurant near Sarp Vasal gate) if you are budget conscious or at Pepper Vine (next to Dhyanlinga) if you are looking for some exotic south indian food. Try to attend the upyoga session that happens next to devi temple. It keeps happening every 30 min. Relax in Surya Kunda mantapam in afternoon seeing other Isha yogis doing their daily practice & listening to falling water in the kund :)
