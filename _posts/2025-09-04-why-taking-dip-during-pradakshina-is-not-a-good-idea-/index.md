During Pradakshina orientation, it is said taking bath before/after Pradakshina is good, but not during Pradakshina.

Sadhguru in the video about Pradakshina said that it is great idea to go to Dhyanlinga with wet clothes. Then why taking a dip during Pradakshina is discouraged ?

Someone said that it is not a good idea as it breaks the walk rythm. But we do other things like washing legs before entering Surya Kunda. So why not changing clothes & taking dip. Somehow the reasoning did not seem very sound to me.

Anybody else has any relevant input on this ?
