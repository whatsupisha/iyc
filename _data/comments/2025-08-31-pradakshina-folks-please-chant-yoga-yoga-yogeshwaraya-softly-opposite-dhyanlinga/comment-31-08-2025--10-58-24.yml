  Why is this post so passive aggressive? While I totally agree with whatis being requested, the language in some parts is so unsettling as if the writer  is frustrated, almost cursing. Please chant softly near dhyanalingam and while crossing others so that they don't get disturbed is enough. What is up with "a bit of empathy wont hurt" and "empathy to others should be a natural part of spiritual journey, specially at Isha" as if people knowingly are creating/causing disturbance to others, hence lacking empathy. Also to the above comment, if you want to tell someone something, please let them know first hand. If you can muster courage to come to sadhanapada, you can muster courage to talk to ppl.
