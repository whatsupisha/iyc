Been doing yogasanas for 2 months, but some of the asanas like Matsyendra aasana, I am still the same. Not much progression. The front hand is nowhere near the rear hand.

But doing Bear Walk for less than a week & in a few days itself, I noticed I can keep my legs straight (not bent at knees), able to bring feet closer to hands & can also walk reasonbly long & quick.

Is it just me making good progress with Bear Walk but not much with yogasans. What can I do to become better at yogasans ?
