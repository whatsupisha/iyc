So Sadhguru said this during last Sadhanapada monthly meet. I started to follow it & thought share some of my experience.

First the obvious con - 3 minute delay will push the meal end time. I am NOT particularly a slow eater but my food eating speed is inversely proportional to people sitting around me. So when there are fewer people left, there is pressure to finish quickly.

But one advantage I figured of the delay is - you get all the items on your plate before you start to eat :). 

But there is a con to it too. The gravy will also come & your fruit would not have been over. For those who put their fruit down, it isnt a problem but I never keep any of my food items outside the plate. So sometimes I struggle. But an easy fix is, just hold the fruit in your hand till the 3 minute duration is over. Simple :)

Oh btw, 3 minutes is approx 7 brahmanand swaroopa chants. So do try this & make it happen :).
