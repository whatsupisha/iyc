Seasme laddoo for Rs 20 that is sold at Prasadam counter is probably the best & most unique sweet you would have ever eaten. Some ishaites even call it 'multivitamin tab' as it feels rich, fresh & healthy to eat. When Ishaites do not get sweet in Bhiksha Hall, they compensate the miss by eating a seasme laddoo. Note, the prasadam counter mostly take cash & they are very reluctant if you give Rs 100 note for Rs 20 laddoo. They might even say no. One thing you need to be careful, is to check packaging date on wrapper of each laddoo. Beyond 10 days packed laddoo do not taste that good. So check & feel free to return if you are not happy. They will take it back & refund you the money.

The 2nd best snack is Coconut bun available at Velliangiri Unnavagam restaurant next to Suryakund. Among the 3, this is largest as per serving size. It is also available for Rs 20. Note that the restaurant does NOT have it available always. Also the restaurant only take cash. Quite a few Ishaites club the bun with tea & for Rs 40, you know have a filling snack with beverage. Give it a shot when your hunger pangs are high but you do not want to splurge either :).

The third, but probably the most exotic, is the Apple Cake at Pepper Vine, the restaurant next to Dhyanlinga / Valuables Counter. It is for Rs 30. Its size is between seasme laddoo & coconut bun. It is mostly available but not always. It is the cheapest snack at Pepper Vine. Pepper Vine folks take payment with upi, so thats a relief. Apple cake has similar texture to seasme laddoo but the taste is different. It also does NOT have generous amount of ghee as that of seasme laddoo.

If you have your personal favorite snack, drop it in the comment.
