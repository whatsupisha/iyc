My maroon Isha Life yoga mat with a white Isha Life mat cover is missing from the downstairs rack (right side 1st shelf close to stairs) Bhiksha Hall after the first batch this morning. The yoga mat cover has a sticker on it. Please check if someone may have taken it by mistake and return to same place or call this number 8860148448
