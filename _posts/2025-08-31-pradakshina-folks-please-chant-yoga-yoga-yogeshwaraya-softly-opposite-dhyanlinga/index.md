So a lot of folks gather opposite Dhyanlinga to start/end Pradakshina during morning. The number is much larger on days like Ekadashi.

We need to chant yoga yoga yogeshwaraya thrice before the start. We are all in close proximity & if someone chants loudly, the others cant focus on their chant.

Please be mindful of other folks & a bit of empathy wont hurt. You can obviously start chanting louder when you leave Dhyanlinga & pretty much by yourself.

Similarly, if you have habit of chanting loudly, please soften a bit when you crossing another Pradakshina guy or happen to unknowingly tagging along with someone going in your direction & both of you happen to be at same pace.

As Sadhguru says, devotion is 'devoid of yourself'. So empathy to others should be a natural part of spiritual journey, specially at Isha.
