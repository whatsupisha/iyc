  â€‹The idea that "apple cake" is cheaper because it's made from leftovers and contains no apples is a popular old joke, not a reality. It plays on the idea that "apple" in "apple cake" is a misnomer, and that the cake's name comes from something other than the fruit. This is similar to how "pineapple cake" or "banana cake" actually contains those fruits.
