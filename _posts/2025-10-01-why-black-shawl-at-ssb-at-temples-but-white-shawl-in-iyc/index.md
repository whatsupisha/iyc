Recently came to Sadhguru Sannidhi & saw that people are asked to put on black shawl while serving at Naga or Yogeshwara linga temple.

But in IYC, Linga Seva involves wearing white cloths. I understand red shawl for devi temple. But Linga Seva people also serve at Yogeshwara linga in IYC in white shawl.

Sadhguru had spoken on importance of NOT wearing black clothes as they absord all kind of (negative) energies. I thought black shawl made sense in consecrated areas to absord most amount of good energy around. But then why white cloths at IYC ?

Does anyone know or is there any video where Sadhguru had explained the different color shawl to be worn at these consecrated areas ?
