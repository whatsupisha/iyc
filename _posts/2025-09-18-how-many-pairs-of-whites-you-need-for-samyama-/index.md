Sadhanapada team has sent out form to show interest for Samyama clothing. Does anyone know how many pairs we need . Basically, how many days the event go, do you get a chance to wash clothes (like in BSP they ask you not to wash but if you really want, you can wash in the night). Anybody can throw some light on this.
