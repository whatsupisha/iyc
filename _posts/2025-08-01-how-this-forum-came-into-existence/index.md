During my stint at Sadhanapada, I discovered cool things which I wanted to share with other. Like cheap but good Linen pant link on Amazon which others could buy from. I also had multiple instances where I needed help but my sangha members could not help. I felt like creating a whatsapp group of all Sadhanapda people but then, I thought, why not a forum where people can ask or share their ideas and others can just respond.

My seva was chill in the first month of Sadhanapda and that is when I decided to build this forum. Things are intentionally kept anonymous so that people can ask things without fear of getting judged. Or ask questions which they feel shy .. like am I taking my right (well .. right here is not right in left/right but right/wrong) leg back in surya kriya .. or is it the other one :) . 

The forum is powered by github pages. Every post/comment submission creates a new git commit which is then processed by Github actions and then it shows up on the wesite. So there is going to be some delay (around 1-2 minutes) after which your post or comment will show up on the website. So please be patient & do not resubmit :). 

As Sadhguru says  - Lets Make It happen. I decided to just do that when I got the calling to put together this forum. 

May the force of Sadhguru be with all of you reading this post :).
