So I fell sick, went to the doctor who diagnosed me with fever & high BP, suggested to not do any strenuous activity till I recover. Gave me medicine for 3 days but on asking for writing exemption from yogasana, refused to do so, saying they are not allowed to write it on prescription. He was Sadhanapada himself.

I applied for exception for 3 days. But the sadhanapada team updated it to one day & approved. My messages on the exception has not got any revert from sadhanapada team. 

Do people apply for one exception for each day ? Is there a way to get longer exemption ?
