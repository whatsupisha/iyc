  > If we are just doing Shakti Chalana Kriya, there is no preparatory asanas right?
  
  Ya, if you dont do Surya Shakti & directly get to Shakti Chalana kriya, there are no preparatory asanas. I am actually not sure when to check for blocked nose though. Before the start of the kriya or before starting sukha kriya before Mahata Prana kriya
