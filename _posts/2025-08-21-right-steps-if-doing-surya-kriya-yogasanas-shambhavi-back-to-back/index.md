I start with preparatory asanas before Surya Kriya, do a quick few min Shava asanas after Surya Kriya, then do Uddyan Bandha. I have questions after that

1. We do Uddyan Bandha after Yogasana, so can we skip it after Surya Kriya ?

2. Is there need to do Nadi Vibhajan again before start of Yogasanas ? As this was done during preparatory asana before Surya Kriya anyway.

3. Is there need to do Patanga asana & Shishupal asana after Yogasana, before Bandhas ? Or is it that since we have done both before Surya Kriya, we dont need to do them here again.
