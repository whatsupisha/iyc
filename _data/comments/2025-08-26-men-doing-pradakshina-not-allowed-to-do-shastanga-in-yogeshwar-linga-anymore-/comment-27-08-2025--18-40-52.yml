  Heard back from sadhanapada team. The person seemed a bit clueless & did not really check with folks at Yogeshwara linga. He said sometimes the volunteers will get mandate from the swami but overall there is no such rule. So it seems to be dependent on what the volunteers/swami at Yogeshwara linga is feeling that day. Best not to do shastanga to avoid any surprises :)
