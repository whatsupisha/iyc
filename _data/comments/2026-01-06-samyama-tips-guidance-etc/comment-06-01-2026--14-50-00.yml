  A few that I could gather from a friend who attended in December. 
  - (needless to mention) get in the queue early so that you can pick a bed next to pathway. It would be easier for you to get in/out before/after session. Also Sadhguru roams around on the path so you can have close proximity. 
  - You eat on a plate with food pre-served. It may get cold. So you can try to go for food a bit late, pick a washed up plate & then get fresh serving of food. 
  - Carry white socks as the floor can get pretty cold.
