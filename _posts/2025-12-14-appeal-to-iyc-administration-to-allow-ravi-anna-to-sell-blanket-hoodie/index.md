Samayama Dec date is close & I got to know that Administration (or some specific swami) asked Ravi anna not to sell items in IYC premises. I personally feel this cause major inconvenience. Thought of using this platform as a way to see how many people feel the same (it is anonymous so your identity will not be revealed). Put +1 in comment if you do. If we get sizeable people, I will either try to approach administration or raise a request in SP app with link to this post.
