So you need to create one exception for each day you miss yogasana, after you have missed the session. The key is - the validity of the doctor prescription plays an important role. If the prescription is for 3 days, you exceptions for 3 days will get approved. 

Sometimes doctor will write the validity on prescription but if they do not, the number of days of medicine is taken as validity. If you have not recovered by the end of the validity, you need to visit the doctor again& get a new prescription. 

You can NOT create a multi day exception in advance. Also be aware that a lot of exceptions on your profile will make you ineligible for sadhanapada intensive. So be mindful of exceptions you creating.
