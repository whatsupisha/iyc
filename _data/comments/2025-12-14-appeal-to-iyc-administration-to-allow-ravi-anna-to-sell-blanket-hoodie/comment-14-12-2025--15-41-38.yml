  I am not sure if it is administration or whim of some Swami/Maa. Just to give another example, I usually put aside one of my fruit for the bulls in Nalanda ground. I also carry peel of my fruit to feed them. I do not take extra fruit for them.
  
  Today a swami spotted me & asked me not to feed fruits to bulls. Even after telling that I am feeding from my own quota, he remained insistent & did not provide me with a good reason. It is hard to reason thing out with swamis inside Isha Yoga Center. Maybe some swami approached Ravi anna also out of his whim. Just raising a request on SP app might solve this issue.
