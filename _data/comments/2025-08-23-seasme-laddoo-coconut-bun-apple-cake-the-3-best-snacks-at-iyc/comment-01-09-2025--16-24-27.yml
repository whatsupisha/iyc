  After trying apple cake, i tried other cakes at Pepper Vine & most of them turned out to be disappointing. Carrot cake, chocolate cake. All of them are too hard. 
  
  My opinion changed today when I tried Banana Cake. It was yum. Its for Rs 50 though.
  
  Also, if you have not, try the veg puff for Rs 10 at Neem Point (restaurant close to the parking space of Adiyogi). Tried it yesterday while watching Onam celebration. Its pretty good for Rs 10.
  
  Picture is of Banana Cake.
