  ​Namaskaram,
  
  ​Just a quick suggestion for the January Samyama participants: the Meditation Hall can get quite noisy at night due to Snoring.
  
  ​Make sure to equip yourself with earplugs to ensure you get the restful sleep needed for the program.
  
  ​Best of luck!
  
  
  ​Pranam
